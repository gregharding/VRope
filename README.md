VRope 0.5
=========

A simple rope system for [cocos2d](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org) using [Verlet Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration), based on examples by [YoAmbulante.com](http://www.yoambulante.com/en/labs/verlet.php).

VRope 0.5 for cocos2d 2.0 by [Flightless](http://www.flightless.co.nz). Used in the games [Bee Leader](http://www.flightless.co.nz/beeleader) (iOS release May 2012, Mac release April 2013) and [Bee Leader Free](http://www.flightless.co.nz/beeleader) (iOS release August 2012, Mac release April 2013) for Mac and iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch).

Update of VRope 0.3 for cocos2d 0.99.x by [Patrick Corrieri](http://drycactus.com), posted on the cocos site at [www.cocos2d-iphone.org/archives/1112](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/archives/1112).

### Modifications:

- added retina fix (tested on iPhone 4s and iPad 3)
- added global gravity for points, making it easy to update gravity for the entire rope system
- added individual gravity support for points, making it easy to update gravity for each specific point
- added support to init/attach rope to a joint, rather than two bodies, allowing the rope to join away from body origins
- supports cocos2d 2.0

### TODO:
- add nicer gravity variables to ropes and points, rather than using a global gravity hack in VPoint
- remove references to older/deprecated cocos2d classes/methods, pre-cocos 1.x

Usage
-----

Refer to VRope.h for more information and usage examples, including the original VRope 0.3 usage.

### Create

    // create joint between bodyA and bodyB
    b2RopeJoint* bodyAbodyBJoint = (b2RopeJoint*)b2World->CreateJoint(&bodyAbodyBJointDef);
    
    // create batchnode and vrope for joint
    CCSpriteBatchNode *ropeSegmentBatchNode = [CCSpriteBatchNode batchNodeWithFile:@"ropesegment.png"];
    [self addChild:ropeSegmentBatchNode];
    VRope *verletRope = [[VRope alloc] init:bodyAbodyBJoint batchNode:ropeSegmentBatchNode];
 
    // or, create vrope between bodies
    VRope *verletRope = [[VRope alloc] init:body1 body2:body2 batchNode:ropeSegmentBatchNode];
 
### Updating

    // update vrope (like original VRope, without any changing gravity)
    [verletRope update:dt];
    [verletRope updateSprites]; // nb. doesn't need to be in draw loop (could be called internally)
 
    // update vrope (using global gravity, nb. will affect all ropes!)
    CGPoint newGravity = ccp(0.7f,0.7f); // update gravity to something else (based on your simulation, interactivity)
    [VPoint setGravityX:newGravity.x Y:newGravity.y];
    [verletRope update:dt];
    [verletRope updateSprites]; // nb. doesn't need to be in draw loop (could be called internally)
 
    // update vrope (example using gravity for specific ropes or points, the gravity component is preintegrated before being applied to points)
    CGPoint newGravity = ccp(0.7f,0.7f); // update gravity to something else (based on your simulation, interactivity)
    [verletRope updateWithPreIntegratedGravity:dt gravityX:newGravity gravityY:newGravity]; // update gravity for each rope (based on your simulation, interactivity)
    [verletRope updateSprites]; // nb. doesn't need to be in draw loop (could be called internally)


nb. the example `[verletRope updateWithPreIntegratedOriginGravity:dt]` has gravity origin at (0,0) and uses
  an average of bodyA and bodyB positions to determine which way is 'down' for each rope.
  This was used in Flightless's game [Bee Leader](http://www.flightless.co.nz/beeleader).
  Obviously, you can change this method or add others to suit your own simulation.
